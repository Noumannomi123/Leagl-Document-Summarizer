Summary
"In awarding indemnity costs, the court exercises discretion, departing from the normal practice, and requires a special or unusual feature in the case. This principle is supported by Alpine Hardwood Aust Pty Ltd v Hardy Pty Ltd (2002) FCA 224, (2002) 190 ALR 121, where Weinberg J cited Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd (1993) 46 FCR 225, 233, per Sheppard J."
"The general principle governing the exercise of discretion to award indemnity costs in a rejected Calderbank letter is outlined. According to the Full Court in Black v Lipovac (1998) FCA 699, (1998) 217 ALR 386, a mere refusal of a Calderbank offer does not warrant an order for indemnity costs. The High Court in Jessup v Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullet Creative Pty Ltd (2008) FCA 42 emphasized that rejection of an offer is not, in itself, a ground for indemnity costs. To obtain an order for indemnity costs, the offeror must show that the refusal to accept the offer was unreasonable in the circumstances. The reasonableness of the offeree's conduct is viewed in the light of the circumstances that existed at the time the offer was rejected."
"In exercising discretion on costs, the court normally awards costs on a party-party basis. However, in exceptional cases with special or unusual features, indemnity costs may be awarded, as seen in Alpine Hardwood Aust Pty Ltd v Hardy Pty Ltd [2002] FCA 224; 190 ALR 121. This principle is supported by Colgate Palmolive Co v Cussons Pty Ltd [1993] 46 FCR 225, 233, as cited by Weinberg J."
"The general principle governing the exercise of discretion to award indemnity costs is that a mere refusal of a Calderbank offer does not warrant an order for indemnity costs. To obtain such an order, the offeror must show that the refusal to accept the offer was unreasonable, considering the circumstances that existed when the offer was rejected. This principle is based on the judgments in Black v Lipovac (1998) and Jessup v Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullet Creative Pty Ltd (2008). Key entities involved: Calderbank, Black, Lipovac, Jessup, Dais Studio Pty Ltd, and Bullet Creative Pty Ltd."
"The principle of exercising discretion in a transformed way, as established in the case of John Hayes & Associate Pty Ltd v Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 201, requires careful consideration to avoid limiting discretion by referencing a closed category. This approach was reiterated by Hill J. In a separate case, Dr. Martens Australia Pty Ltd v Figgins Holding Pty Ltd (2000) FCA 602, Goldberg J also emphasized the importance of exercising discretion with caution. Key entities involved include John Hayes & Associate Pty Ltd, Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Ltd, Dr. Martens Australia Pty Ltd, and Figgins Holding Pty Ltd."
"The text discusses the consideration of rolled offers in the context of cost disputes. The decision in GEC Marconi Systems Pty Ltd v BHP Information Technology Pty Ltd (2003) is cited, where the court held that the refusal of a rolled offer may detract from the weight given to the refusal in exercising discretion. The general approach is to consider the reasonableness of the offer, with the proposition that an unreasonably refused offer may support a claim for indemnity costs. The text highlights that in certain circumstances, a rolled offer may be refused, but this may still support a claim for indemnity costs if the applicant is unsuccessful."
"The legal principle emphasizes the importance of exercising discretion in a judicial manner, ensuring it is not fettered by a rigid transformation approach. This principle is supported by case law, specifically John Hayes & Associate Pty Ltd v Kimberly-Clark Australia Pty Ltd (1994) 52 FCR 201, where Hill J emphasized the need for caution in circumscribing discretion, referencing a closed category as a necessary condition for exercising discretionary power. This principle is also reiterated in Dr. Martens Australia Pty Ltd v Figgins Holding Pty Ltd (2000) FCA 602, 15, per Goldberg J."
"

The case involves a dispute between Sirtex and UWA (University of Western Australia) regarding a breach of fiduciary duty by Dr. Gray, an employee of UWA. Sirtex made an offer to UWA, which depended on UWA establishing that Dr. Gray had breached his fiduciary duty and that Sirtex was accessorially liable. UWA acted unreasonably in rejecting Sirtex's offer, and the court will consider whether UWA had a reasonable cause of action against Dr. Gray. The case hinges on the existence of an implied term in Dr. Gray's employment contract with UWA. The court will also consider whether Sirtex had knowledge of Dr. Gray's alleged breach and whether UWA's delay in commencing proceedings affects its case. Key entities involved are Sirtex, UWA, and Dr. Gray. The case references the previous judgment of Sackville v. News Limited (2007) 244 ALR 374."
"In the 2006 High Court decision of Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill (2006 HCA 46), the court clarified the principles for granting interlocutory injunctions in defamation cases. The Chief Justice Gleeson and Justice Crennan established a general principle, outlining the necessary elements for granting relief: the plaintiff must show a serious question to be tried, a likelihood of suffering injury or damage, and that an adequate remedy is not available. The court must then balance the convenience of granting the injunction, weighing the competing interests."
"The case is Hexal Australia Pty Ltd v Roche Therapeutic Inc [2005] FCA 1301, heard on 22 September 2006, with judgment delivered on 3 October 2006. The Honourable Justice Weinberg presided over the matter. The applicant, Hexal Australia Pty Ltd, was represented by Mr. BN Caine SC and solicitors Blake Dawson Waldron, while the respondent, Roche Therapeutic Inc, was represented by Mr. PW Collinson SC and solicitors Deacon. The judgment relates to an interlocutory injunction, where the court considered the principles of likelihood of irreparable harm and speedy trial in determining whether to grant the injunction sought."
"In the case of Hexal Australia Pty Ltd v Roche Therapeutic Inc (2005) 66 IPR 325, Justice Stone established that the likelihood of irreparable harm is a separate element to be considered when granting an interlocutory injunction, citing the well-known passage from the judgment of Mason ACJ in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia (1986) HCA 58, 161 CLR 148 at 153, in support of this proposition."
"A quia timet proceeding in court requires a degree of probability of apprehended injury, with a sufficient degree of seriousness, to justify intervention. The court will grant an injunction unless the respondent can prove a clear case of illegality, and the applicant must show that the injury cannot be sufficiently compensated. The court will consider the likelihood of injury occurring, and if it is sufficiently high, quia timet relief may be granted to prevent future injury. The court will balance the need for intervention with the availability of alternative remedies. Key cases referenced include R v McFarlane (Ex parte O'Flannagan and Kelly) [1923] HCA 39, 32 CLR 518 and Dr. C.F. Spry, Equitable Remedies (6th ed, 2001)."
"The commonwealth revenue debt case involves a cheque given as payment for a debt, which operates as a conditional payment subject to the condition that the cheque is paid upon presentation. If the cheque is dishonoured, the debt revives. The Deputy Commissioner of Taxation accepts this general position, and in this case, a cheque was proffered on behalf of Ganter on November 10, 2008, which may provide comfort to the Deputy Commissioner in deciding to accept the position. The key entities involved are the Commonwealth, the Deputy Commissioner, Ganter, and the bank."
"A cheque, including a bank cheque, is not legal tender in Australia, but may be considered as such under specific contractual or statutory provisions. This is supported by the Reserve Bank Act 1959 and the Currency Act 1965. In a trade or commerce context, a cheque can be considered sufficient payment, as observed by Mason J in George v Cluning (1979). However, if an objection is raised, the payment is subject to the condition that the cheque is paid upon presentation."
"A Deputy Commissioner has the obligation to accept a proffered cheque to pay a debt, as per the Corporation Act 2001 (s.459C(2)a). If the cheque is refused, it would eliminate the debt, as seen in Australian Mideastern Club Ltd v Yassim (1989) 1 ACSR 399, 403 NSWCA and Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd (2005) FCA 830, per Gyles J."
"The deputy commissioner's obligation to accept a proffered cheque to pay off a debt is discussed in the context of a winding up application under the Corporation Act 2001. The company, Ganter, had failed to comply with a statutory demand, and the creditor, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, had filed a winding up application. However, before the hearing, Ganter paid the debt with a cheque, which was accepted by the Deputy Commissioner. The court found that the payment eliminated the debt, and as a result, the winding up application was dismissed. The court relied on previous cases, including Australian Mideastern Club Ltd v Yassim (1989) and Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd (2005), which established that a creditor must continue to exist at the time of the winding up application, and that the court has discretion to dismiss the application if the debt has been paid. The Deputy Commissioner, as a model litigant, had an obligation to accept the cheque and dismiss the winding up application."
"The court has jurisdiction to order the winding up of a company if it fails to comply with a statutory demand. In Zeeman v Guy Holding Pty Ltd (1994) 116 FLR 314, the court concluded that a presumption arises when a company fails to comply with a statutory demand, and the onus is on the company to provide a positive reason why a winding up order should not be made. This conclusion was also supported in Gyles J Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd. The court's discretion in hearing a winding up application is guided by section 459P of the Corporations Act, and a winding up order would ordinarily be exercised unless a positive reason is established."
"The text discusses the requirements for a creditor to petition for the winding up of a company under the Corporation Act. According to the Deputy Commissioner, a creditor must continue to be a creditor at the time of the winding up application. This requirement is supported by the judgement in Motor Term Co Pty Ltd v Liberty Insurance Ltd (1967) 116 CLR 177, where Menzies J opined that a creditor's petition would be dismissed if the debt is paid before the application is heard. The case emphasizes the statutory regime of winding up a company, citing Section 459A(1)(b) of the Corporation Act. The Deputy Commissioner's view is influenced by the judgement of Barwick CJ and the decision in Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Visidet Pty Ltd. The key entities involved are the creditor, the Deputy Commissioner, and the court."
"In the High Court of Australia case S395/2002 and S396/2002 (2003 HCA 71, 216 CLR 473), the appellant, a Bangladeshi national, claimed refugee status due to persecution as a homosexual in Bangladesh. The delegate of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs rejected the claim, finding that the appellant could live discreetly in Bangladesh to avoid persecution. The High Court held that the tribunal erred in law by imposing a requirement on the appellant to live discreetly in Bangladesh, as this involved an error of fact in finding that the appellant would indeed live discreetly if returned home. Key entities involved: appellant, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, High Court of Australia."
"The matter is remitted to the tribunal for reconsideration, citing Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang (2003) 215 CLR 518 and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu (1998) FCA 334, 82 FCR 374, to reconsider the issue of estoppel, which was not properly addressed in the previous decision."
"The text references two cases: Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Morale (1998) FCA 334, (1998) 82 FCR 374, and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Wang (2003) 215 CLR 518. The matters involve the plain order being set aside and remitted to the tribunal for reconsideration, with no issue estoppel founded. The context of the proceedings and High Court decisions are mentioned."
"In the case of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Ex Parte Durairajasingham (2000) HCA 1, the High Court of Australia ruled that a tribunal's primary decision-maker must provide detailed reasons for believing or disbelieving a particular witness, including the credibility assessment, to ensure transparency in the decision-making process."
"The decision is deemed perverse to an extent that exhibits a serious failure in the decision-making process, resulting in an unreasonable conclusion that exceeds the authority's power, as established in the case of TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (1992) 28 ALD 829 at 861."
"The High Court case of Waterford v Commonwealth (1987) HCA 25 highlighted that a decision made in good faith by a tribunal, although containing an error of law, cannot be set aside solely due to the tribunal's factual findings. However, if the decision is deemed unreasonable in the Wednesbury Corporation sense, it can be set aside. The case emphasized that a decision made with an ulterior purpose or lacking impartiality in the fact-finding process can be overturned. Key entities involved: Waterford, Commonwealth, High Court, and the third tribunal."
"On 15 June 2007, an order was made to extend the convening period for a creditor's meeting under Section 439A of the Corporation Act 2001 (CTH) to midnight on 23 July 2007. This relates to the matter of Estate Property Group Limited, with Hayes appointed as administrator. An ancillary order was also made in relation to Australian Capital Reserve Limited, with an administrator appointed on 12 June 2007. The decision period was extended under Section 441A(1)(b) of the Act. A further order was made on 13 July 2007, extending the convening period for a second meeting of creditors to midnight on 31 August 2007, under Section 447A of the Act."
"On June 15, 2007, an order was made to extend the convening period for a creditors' meeting of Estate Property Group Limited, pursuant to Section 439A of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The Administrator, Hayes, was appointed. This order is related to a previous application concerning Australian Capital Reserve Limited, where an Administrator was appointed on June 12, 2007. The decision period was extended under Section 441A(1)(b) of the Act. A subsequent order was made on July 13, 2007, to extend the convening period until August 31, 2007, under Section 447A of the Act. The matter involves High Tower Investment Pty Limited, where an Administrator was appointed."
"The summary relates to a series of orders and applications made under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) in relation to the Estate Property Group and Australian Capital Reserve Limited. On 15 June 2007, an order was made extending the convening period for a creditors' meeting under s 439A of the Act. The Administrators of the Estate Property Group, Hayes, and Australian Capital Reserve Limited were appointed and various court applications were made, including FCA 935, FCA 1028, and FCA 1328. The convening period was extended to 31 August 2007, and ancillary orders were made to achieve certain results. The judgments referred to are FCA 935, FCA 1028, and FCA 1328, which are related to the matter of Australian Capital Reserve Limited and High Tower Investment Pty Limited."
"On March 30, 2006, Siopis J made an interim order restraining the defendant from removing property from Australia or dealing with it, except to the extent set out in the order. The defendant was also directed to surrender their passport. On April 5, 2006, the order was published. In the Australian Securities and Investment Commission matter of Richstar Enterprise Pty Ltd (ACN 099 071 968) v Carey (2006) FCA 366, the order was extended on April 7, 2006, and again on April 12, 2006. A hearing for the substantive application was set for April 20, 2006, and the order was extended until 5pm on that day. Judgment on the substantive application was reserved until 2:15pm on April 20, 2006. An application was made on behalf of the second defendant to set aside the ex parte order made by Siopis J, citing non-disclosure of material evidence by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC). The interim freezing order is set to lapse today."
"In ASIC v MauerSwisse Security Ltd (2002) 20 ALC 1530, Palmer J ruled that a person's interest may be protected under Section 1323 of the Corporations Act. The court considered the nature of the risk assessed and the extent of fraud perpetrated, acknowledging that little information may be available, leading to a limited investigation and prosecution of claims. The ASIC has the power to conduct investigations to identify wrongdoers and impose penalties under the Corporations Act, which also allows for victim compensation claims."
"An order may be made for the preservation of assets in certain circumstances, such as during an investigation or prosecution. This order, known as an interlocutory order, can be sought by an aggrieved person to prevent the disposal of assets by the relevant person liable, pending the outcome of the investigation or civil proceeding. The court may grant such an order to preserve the status quo, as held in CAC v Lone Star Exploration NL (1988). The order may be temporary in nature, pending the final determination of liability, and can be made under section 132(3) of the relevant legislation."
"A court may make an order to protect the interests of a person at risk, particularly in circumstances involving asset dissipation, as demonstrated in Australian cases such as Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd (1989) 7 ACLC 467, 476 (Powell J), and Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Adler (2001) 38 ACSR 266, 7 (Santow J), where the court requires a prima facie case of liability to be made by the relevant person."
"A court may make an order under Section 1323 to protect interests, following a risk assessment and judgment. This requires the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to demonstrate a prima facie case of liability against a relevant person, following the principles set out in Corporate Affairs Commission v ASC Timber Pty Ltd (1989) and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Adler (2001). The court's decision is necessary and desirable to prevent the dissipation of assets."
"The court is considering an application for a receiver to be appointed to manage and liquidate assets in a case involving allegations of fraud. The court must weigh the risks and consider the nature of the assets and the likelihood of dissipation. The appointment of a receiver is an extraordinary step that may be justified in circumstances where there is a real doubt about the existence or location of assets. The court must consider the evidence and the risk of dissipation, and may rely on hearsay evidence in making its decision. The defendant has objected to the admissibility of certain evidence, including transcripts of examinations conducted under s. 683 of the ASIC Act, which may be admissible under s. 77 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). The court must also consider whether to order the defendant to pay the costs of the receiver. Key parties involved include the claimant, the defendant, and ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission)."
"

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) charged Pegasus Leveraged Option Group Pty Ltd's sole director, Mr. McKim, with operating an unregistered managed investment scheme. The court found Mr. McKim to be the person operating the scheme, as he formulated and directed the scheme, was actively involved in its day-to-day operation, and supervised others' performance. The court ruled that Mr. McKim was not exempt from liability as he was not merely an agent or employee. The ASIC sought a declaration that Pegasus contravened the Corporations Act and an order to wind up the company. The court recognized ASIC's role in enforcing the law and protecting investors, and may make a declaration to mark its disapproval of contravening conduct."
"The court case Australian Security Investment Commission v McNamara (2002) 42 ACSR 488 is referenced, where Mansfield J concluded that a director of a company managing a scheme can be held responsible for operating the scheme in contravention of the statute (s 601EB(5)). This ruling is supported by similar cases, including ASIC v Takaran Pty Ltd (2002) 194 ALR 743, where it was established that the scheme operator is responsible for winding up the scheme in the public interest. The court emphasizes the importance of transparency and safeguarding the rights of contributories during the winding process, and notes that an independent party may be appointed to conduct the winding up, as seen in Bell Security Pty Ltd v LPG Mourant (2002) QSC 156."
"The 911A Act extends to company directors' conduct involving a company carrying on a financial service business without an Australian Financial Service (AFS) licence, as upheld in various cases, including Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) v Giann & Giann Pty Ltd (2005), ASIC v Manito Pty Ltd (2005), and ASIC v Drury Management Pty Ltd (2004), emphasizing the importance of obtaining an AFS licence for financial service businesses."
"The 911A Act extends to company directors involved in carrying on financial services business without an Australian Financial Services Licence, as established in multiple cases, including Australian Security Investment Commission v Giann & Giann Pty Ltd (2005), Australian Security Investment Commission v Manito Pty Ltd (2005), and Australian Security Investment Commission v Drury Management Pty Ltd (2004)."
"The Australian 911A Act extends to company directors who engage in financial service business without an Australian Financial Service Licence, as held in various cases, including Australian Security Investment Commission v Giann & Giann Pty Ltd (2005 FCA 81, 141 FCR 278), Australian Security Investment Commission v Manito Pty Ltd (2005 53 ACSR 56), and Australian Security Investment Commission v Drury Management Pty Ltd (2004 QSC 68)."
"In Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission (1992) 175 CLR 564, the High Court of Australia held that the Superior Court has inherent power to grant declaratory relief, which is discretionary and should not be fettered by laying down rules. The court's power should be exercised with consideration of the boundaries of judicial power, as emphasized by Brennan J."
"The Australian Courts have recognized the importance of declaratory relief applications, as seen in Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) (1981) and subsequent cases, such as Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) and Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) v Sweeney (2001). The ASIC, a statutory body, may serve important law enforcement purposes by making declarations, which can be an appropriate way to mark the court's disapproval of contravening conduct. This is particularly relevant when a court finds that a company has contravened the Act in a specified respect, and the declaration serves as a record of the outcome of the enforcement proceeding, as seen in Tobacco Institute Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (1993)."
"The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has the power to seek declaratory relief, as recognized by the High Court in Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) (1981) to serve important law enforcement purposes. This power is supported by various court cases, including Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) and Australian Securities Investment Commission v Sweeney (2001). The court may make a declaration where ASIC's application under the Administration and Enforcement Act has been contravened, and this declaration serves as a record of the outcome of the enforcement proceeding, marking the court's disapproval of the contravening conduct."
"The Australian Court has recognized the importance of declaratory relief in serving law enforcement purposes, particularly in cases involving statutory bodies like ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission). ASIC may apply for declaratory relief to mark the court's disapproval of contravening conduct, as seen in cases such as Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) (1981) and Australian Security Investment Commission v Sweeney (2001). This relief can also serve as a record of the outcome of enforcement proceedings, highlighting contraventions of the Act."
"The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) may seek declaratory relief against a statutory body, as recognized by the High Court in Australian Softwood Forest Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) (1981) 148 CLR 121. This relief serves an important law enforcement purpose, as seen in Corporate Affairs Commission (NSW) v Transphere Pty Ltd (1988) NSWLR 596 and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Sweeney (2001) NSWSC 114. The court may make a declaration to mark its disapproval of contravening conduct, as in Tobacco Institute Australia Ltd v Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations Inc (1993) 41 FCR 80."
"Section 1324 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TPA) allows a State Court to grant an injunction for an appropriate term to restrain a person from engaging in conduct that constitutes a contravention of Part IV or Part V of the TPA. The court has discretion to grant an injunction to prevent repetition of contravening conduct, and the remedy is flexible, allowing the restrained party to apply to rescind the order. The provision aims to deter offenders from repeating the offence and supports the policy underlying the TPA."
"The case of ICI Australia Pty Ltd v Trade Practice Commission (1992) 38 FCR 248, as summarized by Lockhart J, highlights the significance of section 80 of the Trade Practices Act (TPA) in ensuring compliance with commercial regulation legislation. The provision enables the court to grant an injunction to prevent conduct that is likely to contravene the Act. Lockhart J emphasized that such an injunction serves the public interest and differs from the traditional doctrine of granting injunctive relief for protection of private proprietary rights. The court's power to grant an injunction under section 80 is not limited by traditional equitable principles, and the court must consider the width of the power conferred and the scope and purpose of the TPA when determining the appropriate injunctive order. The case sets a precedent for the interpretation of section 80 and its application in ensuring free competition and preventing anti-competitive conduct. Key entities involved include the Trade Practice Commission, ICI Australia Pty Ltd, and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)."
"In the case of Operation 801 TPA, the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia considered the Trade Practices Commission's application for an injunction against ICI Australia Operation Pty Ltd. Lockhart J emphasized that public interest provisions, such as those in Part IV of the Act, attract special consideration and are a primary means of ensuring compliance with commercial regulation legislation. The court recognized that injunctions can be granted to prevent contraventions of the Act, including anti-competitive conduct such as misuse of market power, exclusive dealing, resale price maintenance, price discrimination, and anticompetitive mergers. The court held that in appropriate cases, it has the power to grant an injunction to restrain a respondent from engaging in conduct that constitutes a contravention of the Act, citing Mikasa NSW Pty Ltd v Festival Stores (1972)."
"In ACCC v Ztek Computer Pty Ltd (1997) 78 FCR 197-202, Justice Merkel stated that the court has broad power to grant injunctions under section 80 of the Trade Practices Act (TPA) in the public interest. However, there are limitations to this power, including the scope of the TPA and the requirement for a nexus between the allegedly contravening conduct and the injunction sought. The court must consider the specific circumstances of each case to determine the appropriate injunctive order. The power to grant injunctions under section 80 is subject to at least two limitations, and the court must be mindful of these constraints when making an order."
"The Implicit Merkel J judgment states that an injunction under s.80 may extend beyond specific conduct proven to constitute a contravention, and may be appropriate in cases where there is a sufficient nexus or relationship between the conduct sought to be restrained and the conduct alleged to constitute a contravention of the Act, as noted in ACCC v Real Estate Institute of WA (1999) FCA 1387. The court's evaluative judgment depends heavily on the circumstances of the particular case."
"The Full Court in Foster v Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (2006) FCAFC 21 considered the scope of injunctive relief under s 80 of the Trade Practices Act. The Court held that the power to grant an injunction is wide and not limited by traditional constraints. The Court's power must be exercised judicially and sensibly, considering the statutory purpose and the need to protect the public interest. The case involved an application for an injunction to restrain the fourth respondent from engaging in conduct that constituted a contravention of the Act. The Court granted a wide-ranging injunction, considering the evidence of repeated contraventions and the need to protect the public interest. The decision highlights the importance of considering the wider form of injunctive relief to prevent similar contraventions in the future. Key entities involved include the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the respondent, and the Court."
"The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) v Takaran Pty Ltd (2003) 194 ALR 743 case is referenced, where Barrett J observed that a scheme operated in contravention of the statute, activating public interest in favour of winding up. The ruling cites Australian Security Investment Commission v McNamara (2002) 42 ACSR 488, emphasizing the importance of transparency in the winding process and safeguarding the rights of contributories by committing the winding up to an independent party. This is further supported by Bell Security Pty Ltd v LPG Mourant (2002) QSC 156 and Australian Security Investment Commission v Product Management Group Pty Ltd (2002) 42 ACSR 343, highlighting the significance of transparency and independence in winding up processes."
"The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) seeks a winding-up order against a company that administered an unregistered managed investment scheme, citing investors' protection as a key reason. The court may grant the order, even if evidence suggests the company is insolvent, as seen in the case of Australian Securities and Investment Commission v Chase Capital Management Pty Ltd (2001)."
"This legal document discusses a summary judgment application in the Federal Court of Australia. The applicant, Mr. Gargan, argues that rule 31a is constitutionally invalid under Section 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). However, the court rejects this argument, finding it devoid of merit. The court holds that rule 31a operates to dictate the outcome of the case and may lead to a dismissal of the proceeding. The court must consider the operation of rule 31a, which allows for judgment to be given without argument. The respondents' motion for judgment is noted, and the matter is to proceed under the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth). Key entities involved include Mr. Gargan, the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, and the Federal Court of Australia."
"The respondent relies on the common informer provision of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), citing the judgments of Hely J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Gargan [2004] FCA 707 and Adam J in Gargan v Scott (Unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 27 October 2003) to dismiss the argument, concluding that it lacks substance."
"Mr. Gargan argues that an entitlement issue arises in an application for mandamus, questioning whether a right would vest in the Official Trustee. He cites Daemer v Industrial Commission NSW (1988) 12 NSWLR 45, 54. The court must explore the proposition that a public duty is capable of being litigated through a mandamus application. The duty created is of a public kind, and the court's task is to assess the prospect of success. The application is made pursuant to Section 31A of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth), which provides for summary judgment. The court may give judgment to one party over another if it is satisfied that a party has a reasonable prospect of successfully defending or prosecuting the proceeding."
"The legal argument relies on the common informer provision of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and adopts the judgments of Hely J in Commonwealth Bank of Australia v Gargan [2004] FCA 707, 140 FCR 1, and Adam J in Gargan v Scott (unreported, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 27 October 2003), dismissing the argument as lacking substance."
"The full court in Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2001) FCA 661 rejected Mr. Gargan's argument, which is deemed unsound. Reference is made to Gye v McIntyre (1991) HCA 60, 171 CLR 609, which provides no support for the notion that s. 86 imposes an affirmative duty. The negligence claim, as currently formulated, would not succeed under s. 178-179 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth)."
"The full court in Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2001) FCA 661 rejected Mr. Gargan's argument as unsound. The court referred to Gye v McIntyre (1991) HCA 60, 171 CLR 609, which does not support the notion that s 86 imposes an affirmative duty. The court does not think that a negligence claim could succeed, even if articulated, and that the prospect of a claim is not feasible under the current formulation, as per s 178 and 179 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth)."
"This legal text discusses the considerations a court must make when deciding whether to annul a sequestration order in bankruptcy proceedings. The court must exercise discretion and consider whether the order ought to be made, taking into account any previously unknown facts that may have come to light after the order was made. Relevant cases cited include Samootin v Wagner (2008) FCA 1066, Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2003) FCAFC 315, Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420, Frank ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396, Stankiewicz v Plata (2000) FCA 1185, Williams (1968) 13 FLR 10, and Ditfort ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCA 347."
"The summary revolves around Mr. Gargan's arguments in a legal case. He relies on four main points: firstly, the incompatibility of the Local Court and State Court in the Australian Capital Territory; secondly, the doctrine of ""purpose"" in the Kable case (1996); thirdly, the Common Law Procedure Act 1899 (NSW); and fourthly, the notion of pursuing a civil penalty under the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). The arguments are discussed in the context of a federal court proceeding in Canberra, including the Helys J sequestration order."
"The Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth) grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Bankruptcy Court, with Section 153B providing for annulment of bankruptcy. This section allows the court to annul a bankruptcy order if it is satisfied that the sequestration order ought to have been made, and exercises discretionary power to do so. The court's satisfaction is a condition precedent to exercising this power."
"In this judgment, Honorable Justice Perram dismissed an application by Mr. Gargan, an undischarged bankrupt, to annul a sequestration order made in 1994. Mr. Gargan had previously made an unsuccessful attempt to annul the bankruptcy in 1996. The court found that the application was without merit and was an attempt to relitigate a previously decided matter. The court exercised its discretion to award indemnity costs against Mr. Gargan, citing his extensive and unsuccessful litigation history in this matter. The court was mindful of Mr. Gargan's status as an undischarged bankrupt, which prohibits him from bringing proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 (Cth). The respondents were represented by Mr. CP Carter, Brock Partner, and Mr. SM Golledge, Australian Government Solicitor."
"The court must consider exercising its discretion to annul a bankruptcy in cases where new evidence comes to light that was previously unknown at the time of the sequestration order, as established in Heinrich v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2003) FCAFC 315. This is also supported by cases such as Samootin v Wagner (2008) FCA 1066, Deriu (1970) 16 FLR 420, Frank ex parte Piliszky (1987) 16 FCR 396, Stankiewicz v Plata (2000) FCA 1185, and Ditfort ex parte Deputy Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 19 FCA 347."
"
The respondent, M. NicholsonBrown, responded inadequately to a complaint, failing to provide an adequate analysis of the matter. In their letter, the respondent did not consider specific conduct raised by the applicant, and their response did not take into account relevant material. This is contrary to the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness, as established in Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (1988) and Veal v Minister of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2005). The respondent's solicitor, M. NicholsonBrown, had the opportunity to respond and provide adequate analysis but failed to do so, affecting the decision-making process."
"Section 21R of a relevant Act confers power to appoint, make, grant, or issue an instrument. This power is exercised through a written appointment, which is a valid form of decision-making. This is supported by court cases, including Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1978) 1 ALD 167, affirmed by the Full Court in Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd (1979) 24 ALR 307, as well as Barton v Croner Trading Pty Ltd (1984) 3 FCR 95, and Edenmead Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1984) 4 FCR 348-353."
"The removal or suspension of an individual from a position requires prior consultation with the local Aboriginal community, as mandated by the act. Failure to do so would vitiate the decision and render the removal or suspension invalid. The exercise of power must consider the views of the local Aboriginal community, which is essential in certain circumstances. A breach of this requirement, as seen in cases such as Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) and Bond v WorkCover Corporation SA (2005), would lead to the invalidity of the removal or suspension."
"The respondent, M NicholsonBrown, received a complaint and responded through their solicitor, but the response was deemed inadequate. The respondent's analysis of the matter was inadequate and failed to consider specific conduct. This lack of consideration could have affected the outcome of the decision. The applicant was not provided a sufficient opportunity to respond to the suspension decision, violating natural justice and procedural fairness principles (citing Dennis Willcox Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation [1988] and Veal v Minister for Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005])."
"Section 21R confers power to appoint, make, grant, or issue an instrument in writing, allowing the appointment of a decision-maker to incidentally make decisions in writing. This is supported by court cases, including Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1978) 1 ALD 167, 172, and subsequent affirmations."
"The policy implementation in a matter involving the Minister of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs concerns the discretionary power of the Minister, which may take into account a wide range of factors and sources of information. This was established in the case of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) 205 CLR 507, where the High Court of Australia affirmed the Minister's broad discretionary power. This discretion is not limited and may consider various factors, as also seen in cases such as Murphyores Incorporated Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1976) 136 CLR 1, Hot Holdings Pty Limited v Creasy (2002) 210 CLR 438, and South Australia v O'Shea (1987) 163 CLR 378."
"This text references a case law, specifically Jarratt v Commissioner of Police NSW (2005) 224 CLR 44, where Chief Justice Gleeson emphasized the importance of procedural fairness and natural justice in determining the practical content of fairness in a given case."
"The matter concerns the interpretation of two types of power conferred by an act. The first type of power (section 333) relates to the making of a grant or issue of an instrument, which has immediate legal effect, whereas the second type of power (section 334) relates to making a statutory decision that is operative immediately, but only takes effect once recorded in writing. The distinction between these two types of power is crucial in determining the nature of the decision-making process and its legal implications. The case of Laurence v Chief Navy [2004] FCA 1535, 139 FCR 555 is cited to support this distinction."
"The policy implementation concerning the Minister's discretionary power to take into account a wide range of factors and sources of information, as established in the High Court of Australia cases of Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Jia Legeng (2001) and others, such as Murphyores Incorporated Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1976), Hot Holdings Pty Limited v Creasy (2002), and South Australia v O'Shea (1987). Key entities involved include the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Victorian Community, and respondents in the mentioned court cases."
"The case of Minister Aboriginal Affairs v Pekowallsend Ltd (1986) is cited, where the High Court ruled that the Minister's decision-maker may legitimately consider irrelevant subject matter in limiting the scope of the statute. In the context of the Victorian Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act, the Commonwealth Minister may delegate power to the State Minister, who has discretion to exercise power, appoint inspectors, and consider local Aboriginal communities' input. The Act does not impose limitations on the respondent's power to appoint, suspend, or remove inspectors, and the respondent must consult local Aboriginal communities to ascertain the appointee's expertise. The Act's purpose is fulfilled when an inspector is appointed, and the principal power conferred on the inspector includes making emergency declarations, which may be exercised by the Commonwealth Minister or delegated to a magistrate with local Aboriginal community input."
"The policy implementation is guided by the Minister's discretionary power, as demonstrated in Jia Legeng v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (2001) HCA 17. The High Court ruled that the Minister may take into account a wide range of factors and sources of information when exercising discretionary power. This is supported by other court decisions, including Murphyores Incorporated Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1976) HCA 20, Hot Holding Pty Limited v Creasy (2002) HCA 51, and South Australia v O'Shea (1987) HCA 39. The key entities involved are the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, and the respondents in the mentioned court cases."
The applicant cites Nguyen v Minister for Health and Ageing (2002) FCA 1241 and Registrar of Liquor Licences v Iliadis (1988) 19 FCR 311 to support the proposition that an implied power to revoke or suspend an appointment can be construed as capable of being exercised with less constraint than an express power to appoint. The applicant relies on Section 21R and Section 334 of the Acts Interpretation Act to argue that the power to suspend or remove is conferred and stands as a broad proposition.
"The suspension or removal of an appointment is conditional upon prior consultation with the local Aboriginal community, which is an essential and mandatory requirement. Failure to adhere to this requirement may vitiate the decision and lead to invalidity. This is in line with the judgment in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) and Bond v Workcover Corporation SA (2005), which emphasize the importance of considering the views of the local Aboriginal community in such decisions."
"A public servant, regarded as a servant of the Crown, is capable of exercising independent judgment and making decisions without statutory permission. However, if a decision is made without following the proper order or statutory power, it may be deemed invalid (R v Anderson ex parte Ipecair Pty Ltd (1965) 113 CLR 177). In the case of the appointment of an inspector, a public servant must satisfy a new criterion, and if not, the appointment would be contrary to the scheme of the Act (Pt IIA, Victorian Aboriginal Cultural Heritage). At least nine inspectors must be public servants who satisfy the new criterion, and if not, the suspension decision may be lifted."
"Section 21R confers the power to appoint, make, grant, and issue instruments. This power allows for decision-making, including incidental decisions, as seen in relevant court cases such as Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1978) 1 ALD 167, 172, and affirmed in Full Court in Collector of Customs (NSW) v Brian Lawlor Automotive Pty Ltd (1979) 24 ALR 307. Other relevant cases referenced include Barton v Croner Trading Pty Ltd (1984) 3 FCR 95, 110, and Edenmead Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1984) 4 FCR 348, 352-353."
"The applicant cited two legal precedents, Nguyen v Minister for Health and Ageing (2002) FCA 1241 and Registrar of Liquor Licences v Iliadis (1988) 19 FCR 311, to support the proposition that implied power to revoke or suspend an appointment can be exercised with constraints, even if not explicitly stated, and that the Interpretation Act (Section 21R) allows for a broad interpretation of the power to suspend or remove, as applicable to Section 334 of the Act."
"The policy implementation matter involves the discretionary power of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, as discussed in the 2001 High Court of Australia case Jia Legeng v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] HCA 17, (205 CLR 507, 565). The Minister has the power to take into account a wide range of factors and sources of information when making a decision, as established in this case and reinforced by other cases such as Murphyores Incorporated Pty Ltd v Commonwealth [1976] HCA 20, Hot Holding Pty Limited v Creasy [2002] HCA 51, and South Australia v O'Shea [1987] HCA 39."
"The legal text considers the application of Section 333, focusing on the definition of an ""instrument"" in the context of the Act. The matter references various cases, including X v Australian Crime Commission (2004) and Heselhurst v Government of New Zealand (2002), which addressed the scope of the term ""instrument"". The court in R v Ng and GlaxSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd v Anderson (2003) took a narrow view of the term, limiting it to legislative instruments. The text suggests that the decision in Emmett J's court appeal ought to be followed, which takes a broader view of the term ""instrument"", inclusive of executive and administrative instruments. Key entities involved include the Australian Crime Commission, Government of New Zealand, and GlaxSmithKline Australia Pty Ltd."
"The court emphasizes that a tribunal's discretion must be exercised to control cross-examination of a witness to ensure relevance and prevent repetition and verbosity, as seen in R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (Ex parte Hardiman) (1980) 144 CLR 13 and Australian Postal Commission v Hayes (1989) 87 ALR 283."
"The text references several Australian legal cases: TNT Skypak International Aust Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 82 ALR 175, 178; Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) 76 ALD 321; and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Limited (2003) FCAFC 244, (2003) 133 FCR 290, 42. These cases are cited in relation to the filing of a supplementary notice in response to a question stated in an original supplementary notice, with implications for the application of law."
"The document cites several legal precedents related to the filing of supplementary notices. Specifically, it references TNT Skypak International Aust Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 82 ALR 175, 178, Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) 76 ALD 321, and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Limited (2003) FCAFC 244, 133 FCR 290, 42. These cases are mentioned to support the opposing view on filing supplementary notices, emphasizing the importance of following proper procedure and adhering to established legal principles."
"On February 10, 2005, an application for interlocutory relief was refused, and the decision was upheld on May 3, 2005, when Leave to Appeal was refused by Justice Hely in the Federal Court of Australia (FCA)."
"On February 10, 2005, an application for interlocutory relief was refused (2005 FCA 79). Subsequently, leave to appeal the judgment was denied by Hely J on May 3, 2005 (2005 FCA 541)."
"The document refers to a judgment handed down by Senior Member Kelly in NSD 55/2005, which is concurrent with the Lawrance v President Administrative Appeal Tribunal [2006] FCA 342 case. The background of the decision involves an appeal and a request for a document under the FOI Act, dated 23 February 2004, where the applicant became aware of potential CR involvement in their employment life."
"In Minh v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (1998) 86 FCR 304, 314, Weinberg J emphasized the duty to act fairly, entailing that a party must be given a reasonable opportunity to make relevant submissions, give evidence, and call witnesses. The AAT (Administrative Appeals Tribunal) has control over proceedings to ensure compliance with this principle. Under Section 331A of the AAT Act, the Tribunal has discretion in its procedure, subject to the AAT Act and regulations. In the present proceeding, Senior Member Kelly must consider two key issues: (1) whether the document is in the possession of the CR (Commonwealth Respondent) and subject to the applicant's request, and (2) whether the CR took reasonable steps to search for the document."
"The principle of cross-examination is essential in ensuring procedural fairness, where the decision maker has discretion to control the process to guarantee relevance and prevent repetition and prolixity. This is upheld by the court's direction in R v Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, Ex Parte Hardiman (1980) and Australian Postal Commission v Hayes (1989), emphasizing that a witness's evidence must be properly tested through cross-examination to avoid fettering, and that the court has the power to ensure relevance and prevent unnecessary repetition."
"The supplementary notice cites several legal precedents, including TNT Skypak International Aust Pty Limited v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 82 ALR 175, 178; Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) 76 ALD 321; and Australian Securities and Investments Commission v Saxby Bridge Financial Planning Pty Limited (2003) FCAFC 244, (2003) 133 FCR 290, 42."
"The Federal Court of Australia (FCA) made orders in two liquidation matters: Purchas Matter Estore Pty Limited (FCA 1222) and Purchas Matter Worldwide Worker Pty Limited (FCA 1223). The Court gave directions and made cost orders, finding the cases to be indistinguishable and of the same substance."
"In the Federal Court of Australia (FCA) in 2006, two liquidation cases were heard: Purchas Matter Estore Pty Limited (FCA 1222) and Purchas Matter Worldwide Worker Pty Limited (FCA 1223). The two cases are indistinguishable and the court gave a direction and made an order for costs, providing reasons that were apparent from the aforementioned cases."
"This legal reference cites two court cases: 1) Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v ACN 080 122 587 Pty Ltd (2005) NSWSC 1247, where Young CJ ruled on a taxation matter, and 2) Currabubula Holding Pty Ltd (in liq) ex parte Lord (2004) 48 ACSR 734, 2004 22 ACLC 858, a decision related to company law and liquidation."
"This legal reference cites two court cases: Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v ACN 080 122 587 Pty Ltd (2005) NSWSC 1247, and Currabubula Holding Pty Ltd (in liq) ex parte Lord (2004) 48 ACSR 734, 22 ACLC 858. The propositions from these cases relate to novelty of circumstance and the correct submission of supporting evidence in decision-making, as per Young CJ."
"The 941 EM DG Act outlines provisions for Austrade to determine whether specific requirements are met. Under subsection 2, Austrade's CEO must be satisfied that the conditions in sections 941a and 941b are fulfilled. The CEO's determination is a judgment call, involving a degree of intellectual judgment, as seen in Australian Postal Corporation v Forgie (2003). The decision-making process requires a value judgment, and Austrade's decision can be appealed to the court pursuant to section 44 of the AAT Act. The court may reject the submission that the requirement in section 941 constitutes a jurisdictional fact, and instead, it can be determined as an objective fact."
"The Full Court in Comcare v Etheridge (2006) FCAFC 27, 149 FCR 522, considered the nature of an appeal, determining it to be a question of law, referencing the observation in Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) FCAFC 232, 38 AAR 55, which was approved by Ryan J in Australian Telecommunications Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515."
"In the case of Comcare v Etheridge & Others (2006), the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia (FCAFC) considered the nature of an appeal under Section 441 of the AAT Act. The court determined that the appeal only involves a question of law, citing the observation in Birdseye v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2003) and Australian Telecommunication Corporation v Lambroglou (1990). The court held that the question of law must be properly analyzed and formulary in nature."
"The court decides that a factual question was involved, requiring a determination solely based on law, as the tribunal failed to discharge its obligations according to law, as seen in Collins v Administrative Appeals Tribunal [2007] FCAFC 111, (2007) 163 FCR 35, 55."
"The Full Court in Comcare v Etheridge (2006) FCAFC 27 considered the nature of an appeal, stating that it involves a question of law, which is a narrower appeal. The Court referred to the observation in Birdseye v Australian Security Investment Commission (2003) FCAFC 232, which was approved by Ryan J in Australian Telecommunication Corporation v Lambroglou (1990) 12 AAR 515. The key takeaway is that a question of law can be analysed and identified through a formulary approach, and the Court's role is to determine the correct application of the law, rather than making a discretionary decision."
"In the 1999 High Court of Australia case of Corporation of the City of Enfield v Development Assessment Commission (2000 HCA 5, 199 CLR 135), the court observed that a ""jurisdictional fact"" is a complex element often used to identify the criterion that satisfies a decision-maker's discretion to exercise power."
"In Gedeon v Commissioner of the New South Wales Crime Commission (2008) HCA 43, the High Court considered the concept of ""jurisdictional fact"" and its relevance to exercising statutory power and discretion. The court held that a decision made without the necessary statutory authority is invalid, and the criterion for exercising power must be satisfied. The entities involved are the plaintiff, Gedeon, and the defendant, the Commissioner of the New South Wales Crime Commission."
